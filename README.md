Handy bookmarklet to prepend \<pre\> tags to the inner HTML of the body element.

I use when I see PHP error stack traces that are displayed as HTML, and hence have lost all of their line breaks.

Refer to pre-tag-bookmarklet.js and install this as a bookmarklet (I've tried unsuccessfully to display a bookmarklet link here but it breaks markdown...)
