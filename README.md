pre-tag-bookmarklet
===================

I made this to solve a particular problem I had while working on a Zend Framework site. I'm leaving it here for posterity!

My app was displaying some very long error stack traces which were getting clipped. This bookmarklet prepends a \<pre\> tag to the innerHTML of the body element.

Refer to pre-tag-bookmarklet.js to install as a bookmarklet - I tried to display a bookmarklet-able link here but it broke markdown :(
