pre-tag-bookmarklet
===================

Handy bookmarklet to prepend \<pre\> tags to the inner HTML of the body element.

Use it when error stack traces are displayed with no line breaks to make them readable again.

Refer to pre-tag-bookmarklet.js to install as a bookmarklet - I tried to display a bookmarklet-able link here but it broke markdown :(
