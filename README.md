pre-tag-bookmarklet
===================

This was a bookmarklet I made to solve a particular problem I had while working on a Zend Framework site.

My app was displaying some very long error stack traces which were getting clipped, so I made this to prepend \<pre\> tags inside the body element.

I'm not sure if it works any more but I'm leaving it here for posterity! Refer to pre-tag-bookmarklet.js to install as a bookmarklet - I tried to display a bookmarklet-able link here but it broke markdown :(
